(1)The demo of the hybrid model framework with operating conditions(CNN-LSTM)
(2)This code was written using GNU Octave-10.3.0, which may also run on MATLAB.
(3)This demo is only for illustrating the workflow of the hybrid model framework with operating conditions, as described in "A hybrid modeling framework for predicting the multilayer ceramic capacitor reliability under thermal-electrical coupling operating conditions".
(4)The first section creates virtual samples for this demo and can be removed for engineering use.
